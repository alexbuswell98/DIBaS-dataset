# DIBaS-dataset

Digital Images of Bacteria Species dataset (DIBaS) contains 33 bacteria species with 20 images for each of them. It was collected by the Chair of Microbiology of the Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland (http://www.km.cm-uj.krakow.pl/).

All of the samples were stained using the Gramm’s method. The images were taken with Olympus CX31 Upright Biological Microscope equipped with a SC30 camera (Olympus Corporation, Japan). They were evaluated using a 100 times objective under oil-immersion (Nikon50, Japan).
